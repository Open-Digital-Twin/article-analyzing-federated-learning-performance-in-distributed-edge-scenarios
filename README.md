# Federated Learning

This repository contains server and client code alongside Docker files to be used for distributed federated learning experiments using containers.

## Observability

To generate API documentation for the `docker-handler` service, inside the `observability` folder run:

```
npm run gen-doc
```

A `docs` folder will be created containing the service documentation. To access it, simply open the `index.html` file.
